<h2>What is TutorGroup?</h2>
TutorGroup is an online language learning platform that is the largest English language learning institute in the world. Founded in 2004, TutorGroup has educated more than students in 40 countries, and hosted more than 5 million classroom sessions through its four, award-winning service product businesses, including VIPABC, TutorABC and TutorABC Jr. for English training and TutorMing for Mandarin Chinese.

<h2>What is TutorGroup’s mission?</h2>
We aim to surprise and delight students, no matter where they may be.
We want each single student to get the same learning experience that a group of 1 million would receive.

<h2>What makes TutorGroup different?</h2>
TutorGroup has become the largest English language learning institute in the world, thanks in part to its proprietary online education platform, which dynamically recommends the optimal course size, the best teacher, and the right teaching material from more than 10,000 hours of existing course content.
Its success is based on a database of user preferences and feedback, gathered from millions of classroom sessions over the last 10 years, which is coupled with analytical algorithms and predictive capabilities to optimize the relationship between teacher, student and material in real time.
For students, this means recommending the best course size, learning pace, teacher and content, based on their own results and the results of hundreds of thousands of students before them. For teachers, this means more and greater opportunities as students give them more and better ratings.
Through English-language learning products VIPABC.com and TutorABC.com, students have 24/7 access to more than 2,000 tutors—most of whom are TESOL certified, native English language speakers that live in the United States.

<h2>How is TutorGroup different from other online education companies?</h2>
There is lots of technology infiltrating the education sector. But not all technology in education is education technology.
Some technologies aim to replace teachers altogether. Others believe tablets and digital blackboards are an ed-tech solution. 
To truly scale education—using technology—to teach in a way that fits students for today and for the future, requires a complex technology stack focused around optimized content, 24/7 access and support, and supplying the best teachers from around the globe. 
Founders Ming and Dr. Eric Yang designed algorithms that optimize the way students, lesson content and teachers connect.
The better students and teachers perform, the smarter the system gets – matching students with the teacher and content they need, exactly when needed, in real time.

<h2>How did TutorGroup start?</h2>
TutorGroup was started 10 years ago by a group of consciously post-national academics, executives and brothers. Ming and Dr. Eric Yang – educated in the US and raised in Taiwan and China – wanted to find a way around the limited accessibility and cost of school-based learning, but with supreme quality of what can be offered using data analytics to find the best learning behavior. 
<br>
In particular, they wanted to give millions of Chinese dialect speakers a way to unlock more practical English-language speaking abilities—seeing an opportunity in almost any native speaker of English. They built a new way to use technology and people to scale student-customized education.<br>
Today, thousands of Western teachers know it and work with the company – not to mention tens of thousands of students. If TutorGroup were judged by total enrollment, it would rank among the University of Georgia and Cal-Berkeley and within the top 50 of US universities.

<h2>Why is this model better than standard, brick-and-mortar schools?</h2>
Physical schools are important, and will continue to have a place for the foreseeable future. However, the realities of 21st century life mean that physical schools often restrict access to learning, rather than promoting it.
<br>
By 2050, the world population will reach nearly 10 billion, making schools more crowded, expensive, and with teachers in tighter supply.
<br>
With TutorGroup, quality teachers can reach students in need no matter where they are—regardless of location or physical school nearby.
